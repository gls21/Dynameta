Description: A living-review (continually updateable) R Shiny platform for
    interactive ecological meta-analyses, oriented around testing the
    effect of anthropogenic threats on biodiversity. This platform is
    written as an R package and highly generalisable, such that it can be
    applied in the context of any meta-analytic PICO question concerning
    the effect of any IUCN threat on any taxonomic group, biodiversity
    metric, or geographic region. Analyse sample data included in the
    package or your own data.
